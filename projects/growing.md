<h2>In-engine Interface</h2>
<p>In my competition research prior to designing the UI for this game, I found that motion and ambience were the most important factors in my feelings towards the UI and its ease of use. In Unity I had easier access to animation, so I tried to take advantage of that for this project.</p>

<h2>Playtesting/User Experience</h2>
<p>We conducted four playtests. For each, I planned the data collection strategy, designed surveys, wrote scripts for observational testing, analyzed results in R, and created insight presentations.</p>
<p>For the story aspects of the game, I measured engagement based on anxious/avoidant attachment to the narrator, empathy towards the characters, and immersion in the universe of the story.</p>
<p>For the platforming aspects of the game, I measured success as a rate of item collection in each area, time spent on various challenges, and progression through the game.</p>

<h2>Promotional materials</h2>
<p>I designed the logo, created the website, and produced the teaser trailer (with original music).</p>

<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>I created original music for the menu and trailer, foley &amp; sound effects for the playable character, and ambience for scenes.</p>
