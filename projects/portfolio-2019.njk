        <p>My last portfolio iteration was more of a testament to the speed at which I could develop a website, as opposed to my design thinking. I spent considerably more energy on the portfolio youâ€™re currently viewing, to assure my personality comes through more clearly.</p>
        <p>The 2019 portfolio was built with a customized Nunjucks/Javascript Static Site Generator (SSG). The build emphasized optimized code, data-driven pages, and cool tricks like the hue animation in the background. I found it frustrating to maintain content or customize project presentation, so I took that lesson into this portfolio, and gave myself the freedom for variable screenshot widths, case study lengths, and metadata.</p>
